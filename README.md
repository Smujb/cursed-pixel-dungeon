# Yet Another Shattered Dungeon

Based of Shattered Pixel Dungeon by 00-Evan:
https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon

Which is in turn based off Pixel Dungeon by Wataboutu:
https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon

Version by 00-Evan compatible with newer Android Studio:
https://github.com/00-Evan/pixel-dungeon-gradle

This version of Pixel Dungeon combines features from Shattered Pixel Dungeon by 00-Evan and Yet Another Pixel Dungeon by ConsideredHamster, as well as having minor inspiration from other mods and several original features. It is also easier to mod than other versions, as it has no strict dependence on loading floors in order, and has some stuff in Constants.java to tweak around with.
